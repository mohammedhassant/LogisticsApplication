I create a Action Button to Generate Invoice with Driver charges. And the Invoice Page is developed using VisualForce Page.

Then i created the Dashboard with Priority Based and Delivery Status Based.

I created a Trigger to make our work automate, which means whenever I updates the Delivery Status to the next stage then it automatically sends a mail to the customer's mail Id. To Update the customer every time.

I updated the Delivery Status from Ready To Pick to Dispatched.

Then, this is the mail a customer will receive.
